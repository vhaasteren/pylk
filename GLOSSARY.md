# Glossary

**Signals/Slots** — Qt's event system: objects emit *signals*, other objects *connect* slots (callbacks).
**PINT** — Pulsar timing library; Pylk is a GUI layered on PINT.
**MVC-ish** — Pylk uses models (state), controllers (logic), and views/widgets (UI).
**RAG** — Retrieval-Augmented Generation; use external indexed code/docs to ground LLM outputs.
**MVW** — Minimal Viable Workflow: smallest set of tools to iterate fast.
